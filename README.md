How to merge a pull if the fkng button is disabled by the binary fkng file

To Merge your GUI into my working branch...I did:

in cmd.exe from the git Bash
-git status
--->modified file..CarDealer.suo
then i tell to the git to get ride of that shit with
-git checkout -- CarDealer.suo
then do the merge/pull
-git pull https://github.com/motherdear/CSharp_CarDealer Development_Chris
GOGOOGOG
Warnings and shit but then my visual studio updated, with the stashed changes without commiting. Commit and finish
