How to merge a pull if the fkng button is disabled by the binary fkng file

To Merge your GUI into my working branch...I did:

<<<<<<< HEAD
in cmd.exe from the git Bash -git status --->modified file..CarDealer.suo then i tell to the git to get ride of that shit with -git checkout -- CarDealer.suo then do the merge/pull -git pull https://github.com/motherdear/CSharp_CarDealer Development_Chris GOGOOGOG Warnings and shit but then my visual studio updated, with the stashed changes without commiting. Commit and finish
